# DFA_Builder
This is a Java tool that simulate the function of a DFA (Deterministic Finite Automaton) using a table of transitions. 
To build your own DFA, the program receive a finite alphabet (Î£), the states of the DFA (Q), the final states (F) and
the transitions for the DFA. Finally, the program will ask the user for a string (w) that will be check by the program,
using the DFA built, and will decide if the string (w) is valid or not.
